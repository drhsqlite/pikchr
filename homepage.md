Pikchr (pronounced like "picture") is a [PIC][1]-like markup
language for diagrams in technical documentation.  Pikchr is
designed to be embedded in [fenced code blocks][2] of
Markdown (or in similar mechanisms in other markup languages)
to provide a convenient means of showing diagrams.

For example, the diagram:

``` pikchr indent
arrow; box "Hello, World!"; arrow
```

Is generated by 3 lines of Markdown:

~~~~~~
   ``` pikchr indent
   arrow; box "Hello, World!"; arrow
   ```
~~~~~~

(This whole page is Markdown.

## Source-Code License: 0-clause BSD

The Pikchr source code is a self-contained original work.  It has no
external dependencies apart from the standard C library and does not
use code taken from the internet or other external sources.  All of the Pikchr
source code is released under a [zero-clause BSD license][0BSD].  After being
processed using [Lemon][lemon], the Pikchr source code is a single
file of C89 named "`pikchr.c`".  These features
are designed to make Pikchr easy to integrate into other systems.

## Work In Progress

As of 2020-09-16, the Pikchr code is stable and is in active use.
However, documentation is still under development.
We are using Pikchr to write the Pikchr documentation (in Markdown),
hence it was necessary to deploy Pikchr into a working content
management system ([Fossil][3] in this case) prior to having
complete documentation available.
