## How To Build Pikchr

~~~ pikchr toggle

  Src:      file "pikchr.y"; move
  LemonSrc: file "lemon.c"; move
  Lempar:   file "lempar.c"; move
            arrow down from LemonSrc.s
  CC1:      oval "C-Compiler" ht 50%
            arrow " generates" ljust above
  Lemon:    oval "lemon" ht 50%
            arrow from Src chop down until even with CC1 \
              then to Lemon.nw rad 20px
            "Pikchr source " rjust "code input " rjust \
              at 2nd vertex of previous
            arrow from Lempar chop down until even with CC1 \
              then to Lemon.ne rad 20px
            " parser template" ljust " resource file" ljust \
              at 2nd vertex of previous
  PikSrc:   file "pikchr.c" with .n at lineht below Lemon.s
            arrow from Lemon to PikSrc chop
            arrow down from PikSrc.s
  CC2:      oval "C-Compiler" ht 50%
            arrow
  Out:      file "pikchr.o" "or" "pikchr.exe" wid 110%
