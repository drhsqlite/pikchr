# Text annotations

Objects can have up to 5 separate text annotations.  Each annotation
can have multiple *[text-attributes](./textattr.md)*.

The annotations normally appear stacked above and below the center of the
object.  However, this can be controlled through the use of
various *[text-attributes](./textattr.md)*.

Text annotations are drawn even if the object is marked 
"[`invis`](./invis.md)"
