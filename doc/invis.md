# The invis or invisible attribute

The "`invis`" or "`invisible`" attribute has the effect of setting
the "`thickness`" to zero.  This makes the object disappear.  However,
all text annotations associated with the object are still visible.

Draw rotated text by making the text an annotation on an "`invis`"
line and using the "`aligned`" *[text-attribute](./textattr.md)*.
