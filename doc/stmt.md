# statement

## Rules

  * *object-definition*
  * LABEL **:** *object-definition*
  * LABEL **:** *place*
  * *direction*
  * VARIABLE *assignment-op* *expr*
  * **print** *print-argument* (**,** *print-argument*)\*

## Labels

A label can be attached to either an *object* or a *place* so that
the object or place can be more easily referenced by subsequent statements.
Labels always begin with an upper-case ASCII character.

Labels do not have to be unique.  When there are two or more
labels with the same name, the later one takes precedence.
This allows a label to be effectively redefined.  New labels do not
come into existence until after the object or place to which they are
attached has been completely parsed and analyzed.  This allows labels
to be redefined in terms of themselves.  Consider an example:

~~~~~
/* 01 */        down
/* 02 */  Root: dot "First Root" above color red
/* 03 */        circle wid 50% at Root + (1.5cm, -1.5cm)
/* 04 */        arrow dashed from previous to Root chop
/* 05 */  Root: 3cm right of Root   // Move the location of Root 3cm right
/* 06 */        arrow from last circle to Root chop
/* 07 */        dot "Second Root" above color blue at Root
~~~~~

Line 05 redefines Root in terms of itself.
In the rendering below, you can see that the dashed arrow drawn before
Root was redefined goes to the original Root, but the solid arrow drawn
afterwards goes to the revised location for Root.

/* 01 */        down
/* 02 */  Root: dot "First Root" above color red
/* 03 */        circle wid 50% at Root + (1.5cm, -1.5cm)
/* 04 */        arrow dashed from previous to Root chop
/* 05 */  Root: 3cm right of Root   // Move the location of Root 3cm right
/* 06 */        arrow from last circle to Root chop
/* 07 */        dot "Second Root" above color blue at Root
~~~~~





## Variables

Variable names begin with a lower-case ASCII letter or with "`$`"
or with "`@`".  The $- and @- variable names are a Pikchr extension
designed to help prevent collisions between variable names and the
(numerous) keywords in the Pikchr language.

Pikchr has built-in variables as follows:

>

| scale         |: 1.000 :| Scale factor for drawing.  Larger is bigger.     |
| textht        |: 0.500 :| *Not used by Pikchr*                             |
| textwid       |: 0.750 :| *Not used by Pikchr*                             |
| thickness     |: 0.015 :| Default line thickness for all objects           |


The "VARIABLE *assignment-op* *expr*" syntax is able to modify the value
of built-in variables, or create new variables.  In legacy-PIC, the only
*assignment-op* was "`=`".  Pikchr adds "`+=`", "`-=`", "`*=`", and
"`/=`" to make it easier to scale existing variables up or down.

## Print

The "`print`" statement prints the strings and the values of the expressions
in its argument into the generated output in front of the 
"`<svg>`" element for the diagram.  This facility is intended for testing
and debugging purposes.  There is no known practical use for "`print`" in
a production Pikchr script.
